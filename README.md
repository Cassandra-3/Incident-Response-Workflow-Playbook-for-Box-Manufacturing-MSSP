# Custom Incident Response Workflow & Playbook for Box Manufacturing MSSP  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on designing a **structured Incident Response Workflow and Playbook** for **Box Manufacturing**, a company specializing in cardboard production. The **playbook** is designed to help Box Manufacturing and its **Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP)** respond effectively to cybersecurity incidents, specifically **IoT/endpoint security compromises**.  

The **goal** of this project is to provide **clear escalation criteria, structured response steps, and predefined communication templates** to minimize the impact of security threats on Box Manufacturing's operations.  

## Objectives  
- **Develop a structured incident response workflow** for IoT/endpoint security compromises.  
- **Define escalation criteria** to ensure the right stakeholders are involved at the right time.  
- **Establish roles and responsibilities** for both Box Manufacturing and its MSSP.  
- **Provide standardized communication templates** for effective incident reporting.  
- **Create a step-by-step playbook** to ensure a coordinated response to IoT/endpoint threats.  

## Frameworks & Methodologies Used  
- **NIST 800-61 Incident Response Framework**  
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**  
- **ISO 27001 Security Incident Management Guidelines**  
- **CISA Cybersecurity Best Practices**  
- **ITIL Incident Management Best Practices**  

## Incident Response Workflow  
This playbook follows a **five-phase structured workflow**:  

1️ **Detection & Identification**  
- Monitor network traffic for **unusual behavior** in IoT/endpoint devices.  
- Use **SIEM logs and alerts** to detect security anomalies.  
- Verify incidents using **log analysis, forensic tools, and endpoint monitoring**.  

2️ **Containment**  
- Isolate **compromised endpoints** from the network.  
- Notify **internal IT teams and MSSP** for immediate action.  
- Implement **network segmentation** to prevent lateral movement.  

3️ **Eradication**  
- Remove **malware, unauthorized access, and backdoors** from affected systems.  
- Patch vulnerabilities and apply **firmware updates** to IoT devices.  
- Review **logs, audit trails, and access controls** to ensure no persistence remains.  

4️ **Recovery**  
- Restore systems and IoT devices **to operational status**.  
- Conduct **security validation tests** before reconnecting to production.  
- Notify stakeholders and conduct a **post-incident review**.  

5️ **Lessons Learned**  
- Document the **attack timeline, root cause, and security gaps**.  
- Update **incident response playbooks** based on findings.  
- Train employees and IT staff on **improved security measures**.  

## Incident Escalation Criteria  
Incidents are escalated based on **severity, business impact, and response complexity**. The following conditions trigger escalation:  

 **High Severity** – Major security breach affecting production systems.  
 **Unresolved After 48 Hours** – If containment or mitigation is not successful.  
 **Impact on Critical Systems** – If the attack affects financial, database, or manufacturing systems.  
 **Third-Party Vendor Involvement** – If the incident involves external partners.  
 **Operational Disruption or Revenue Loss** – If production is significantly affected.  
 **Legal or Compliance Risks** – If regulatory or data protection policies are violated.  

## Roles & Responsibilities  
| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |  
|----------|----------------------|  
| **Cat (MSSP Consultant)** | Oversees incident response, coordinates with internal/external teams, ensures playbook compliance. |  
| **Percy (CEO, Box Manufacturing)** | Makes high-level decisions, receives executive updates, manages business continuity strategy. |  
| **Misha/Minka (Production Managers)** | Adjusts production schedules, informs teams about disruptions, ensures minimal operational impact. |  
| **Dusty (Database Specialist)** | Recovers affected databases, ensures data integrity, applies security patches. |  
| **Lucky (IT Support)** | Assists in detecting, containing, and eradicating security threats. |  
| **Ned (Network Admin)** | Monitors and manages network security, isolates infected endpoints, restores network stability. |  
| **Security Operations Center (SOC)** | Monitors and detects threats, provides real-time alerts and forensic analysis. |  

## Communication Templates  
To ensure **clear and consistent communication** during incidents, standardized **technical and non-technical templates** are provided.  

 **Technical Incident Report (for MSSP)**  
- Provides a **detailed technical breakdown** of the compromise, affected systems, and required actions.  
- Includes forensic evidence, timeline of events, and recommended next steps.  

 **Non-Technical Notification (for Clients & Executives)**  
- Provides **a simplified summary of the incident** for stakeholders without technical expertise.  
- Focuses on **impact assessment, immediate actions taken, and business continuity measures**.  

## Playbook for IoT/Endpoint Security Compromise  
The playbook provides a **structured response strategy** to mitigate IoT/endpoint threats efficiently.  

### **Key Objectives**  
✔ **Early Detection:** Identify unauthorized access, abnormal network behavior, or malware infections.  
✔ **Rapid Containment:** Isolate compromised endpoints, disable unauthorized accounts, and restrict access.  
✔ **Complete Eradication:** Remove malware, patch vulnerabilities, reset affected devices.  
✔ **Secure Recovery:** Restore operations securely, verify systems are hardened before reconnecting.  
✔ **Continuous Improvement:** Conduct post-incident analysis, update security policies, and refine detection strategies.  

### **Step-by-Step Response Guide**  
1️ **Detection:** Monitor **SIEM alerts, network anomalies, and endpoint logs**.  
2️ **Containment:** Disconnect **infected endpoints, disable compromised accounts, and block malicious traffic**.  
3️ **Eradication:** Remove **malware, unauthorized access, and vulnerabilities**.  
4️ **Recovery:** Restore **clean backups, patch systems, and validate security controls**.  
5️ **Lessons Learned:** Analyze **attack vectors, update security measures, and enhance team training**.  

## Key Takeaways  
- **Proactive incident response is critical** – Early detection and containment reduce damage.  
- **Clear escalation paths** ensure the right teams are involved at the right time.  
- **IoT security is an ongoing challenge** – Regular patching and monitoring are essential.  
- **Post-incident reviews drive security improvements** – Every incident is a learning opportunity.
